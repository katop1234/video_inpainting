davis - i collected 90 videos, but amir said it moves around too much
segtrack - collected from it, single object but camera does move around. dropped the penguin class because filetype was weird.

possible testing datasets i haven't looked into yet but keeping for future reference:

- SegTrack - also pretty good! https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/segtrack-v2-1
- CVSEG- Really good, but only has ~10 videos! https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/conferencevideosegmentationdataset
- ViSAL - good but skips many frames https://github.com/wenguanwang/ViSal-dataset-for-video-salient-object-detection
- A2D - good but skips many frames also https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jjcorso/r/a2d/

- ADE20K - Just images i think https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/
